# EEG-ReMake
This project is based on work of OpenEEG project and Olimex's implementation of it. This project is free to use, but is bound by Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license. More info can be found at http://openeeg.sourceforge.net .

## Schematics
The scematic and design files are in Eagle file-formats. Inspired by https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/ .

## Documentation
The documentation is in Slovak language and I don't have translation of it. Feel free to use google translator, you should be able to understand it quite well that way.

## The goal
The goal of this project was to customize EEG-SMT by Olimex and design electrodes producable in school environment. I tried to keep expandability of this system open by introducing few new connectors. 

## Not perfect
This design definitely has its flaws, but it was tested and proved working.

## Software
As for software, I used open-source project BrainBay, which can be found here: http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/ .

## Support
Feel free to ask me any questions about this project I will certainly try to answer you.
