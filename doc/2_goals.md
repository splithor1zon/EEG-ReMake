# Goals

The primary goal is the most important one, to build a working EEG hardware (BCI). However, there is quite a long way to go. First of all, you either need to find all the necessary theory and invent the circuitry completely from scratch, or find an open source project that you can modify to suit your needs. If we get one or the other, we can start making a first prototype on which we can test the functionality, or fine-tune certain parameters. The road to the first prototype is a winding one, we need to think first what we actually need, what connection methods, number of electrodes, customizability...

As long as we think about all these parameters, we can start making a schematic in some CAD program, in which we can also directly create the PCB design. The logical step after designing the PCB and selecting the appropriate components is to purchase these components and manufacture the PCB.

Here comes the most stressful part, the functionality testing. As long as the first prototype is functional, there won't be much to change, but there will always be some beauty bug or change in the size of the parts.

That way it's already time for prototype number 2 and also the possible final version. Modification of the PCB, better selection of components... But after this journey, the aesthetic side of this product will also have to be taken care of. Getting a box of adequate dimensions, prioritizing neatness over speed when soldering, making a print and proper labeling for ease of use. All of this will give the effect of perfection to this product.

The next step is to design and manufacture the modules for connection to the recording equipment. For which we need to think about isolation from the environment and power supply.
