# Conclusion

Even after some complications, we can say that the course was smooth. We met all the goals we set, even though we only got the final version as the third prototype. But we take it with a grain of salt, because we know that everything never goes according to plan. In fact, if everything had gone smoothly, then it would have been suspicious.

Scalability and modularity were our main goals for this project. We have created new specific interfaces that, if a rich ecosystem is created, will be of great interest to at least a few students and DIYers around the world. We plan to share this project further and it will be up to the people that whether it takes off.

It is possible that we will use this project for further study. Because this project, if fully understood, has the value of a bachelor's thesis. And there is always something to improve and learn, because biotechnology and connecting biological material with devices is the future. We probably dare not go to study this field, but one has to acknowledge that having a broader outlook is worthwhile.

This project has enriched us more than all the training we have done combined, students should be more and earlier involved in especially the right choice of non-uniform projects. Because only diversity and other "special" practices bring innovation.
